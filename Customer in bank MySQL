To create a table to store customer details in a bank, perform transactions like withdrawal and 

deposit, and determine the customer level (SILVER, GOLD, or PLATINUM) based on their credit 

limit, you can follow these steps using MySQL:

Step 1: Create the Customer table Create a table called Customer with columns for customer 

details and credit limit:

sql

CREATE TABLE Customer (

 customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,

 customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

 account_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,

 credit_limit DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,

 balance DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL

);

Step 2: Insert customer data Insert some sample customer data into the Customer table:

sql

INSERT INTO Customer (customer_id, customer_name, account_number, credit_limit, 

balance) VALUES

 (1, 'John Doe', '1234567890', 50000.00, 10000.00),

 (2, 'Jane Smith', '0987654321', 20000.00, 15000.00),

 -- Add more customer data here...

Step 3: Perform transactions (withdrawal and deposit) Perform transactions to update the balance of

a customer. For example, to withdraw an amount:

sql

UPDATE Customer

SET balance = balance - 5000.00

WHERE customer_id = 1;

To deposit an amount:

sql

UPDATE Customer

SET balance = balance + 10000.00

WHERE customer_id = 2;

Step 4: Determine customer level (SILVER, GOLD, or PLATINUM) using IF or CASE statements 

Use the IF or CASE statements to determine the customer level based on their credit limit:

Using IF statement:

sql

SELECT customer_name, credit_limit,

 IF(credit_limit > 50000, 'PLATINUM',

 IF(credit_limit > 10000, 'GOLD', 'SILVER')) AS customer_level

FROM Customer;

Using CASE statement
SELECT customer_name, credit_limit,

 CASE

 WHEN credit_limit > 50000 THEN 'PLATINUM'

 WHEN credit_limit > 10000 THEN 'GOLD'

 ELSE 'SILVER'

 END AS customer_level

FROM Customer;

These queries will retrieve the customer's name, credit limit, and their respective customer level 

(SILVER, GOLD, or PLATINUM) based on their credit limit.

Please note that in the example above, we assume the credit limit and balance values are stored as 

DECIMAL(10, 2) data types. Adjust the data types accordingly based on your specific 

requirements.

By executing these SQL queries in MySQL, you can create a customer table, perform transactions, 

and determine the customer level based on their credit limit.
